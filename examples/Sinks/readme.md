# Apache Flink Sinks

Let's forget the job logics or stuff.\
In each flink job you finally have to write your data somewhere!

This act of writing your data somewhere is named `sink`.\
So you will `sink` your result datastream into a Kafka topic,some Database or etc.

We would have some examples of these kinds of sinks in this package!

Here you can see all those connectors:\
