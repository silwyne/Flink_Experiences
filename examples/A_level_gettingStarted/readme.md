# First Flink Job

I remember when I wanted to run my first flink job I had no idea of what can I do.\
The most important thing that I need was a simple `datastream` so I can see how `flink` prints data on `console` in stream mode!\
So you can process it or do anything you want with it, so you can start to learn `flink` .

This job is for that!

In this flink job which I consider it as you first, you're going to see how to simulate a dataStream in flink.
And how to print it in `Console`.

This is the link to `DataGen` connector Docs! you can read it if you want ;)
