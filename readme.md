# My Flink Experiences

I am seyed mohamad hasan tabatabaei asl!

The point of making this git repo is to share my Flink experiences.\
I know there is a good documentation for Apache Flink.\
but I believe it is more efficient for beginners to learn from examples!

happily the repository has some examples, so you can read each example and learn something new!

>[!NOTE]
> - you can run all the examples separately.
> - You need nothing more than (Jdk 11) and dependencies present on your development environment.
> - This is possible because all the examples has simulated input datastream provided by flink itself.
