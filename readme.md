# My Flink Experiences

I am seyed mohamad hasan tabatabaei asl!

The point of making this git repo is to share my Flink experiences.\
I know there is a good documentation for Apache Flink.\
but I believe it is more efficient for beginners to learn from examples!

happily the repository is full of examples, so you can read each example and learn something new!
